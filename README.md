# ML
Machine Learning algorithms applied to real-world datasets and measure the accuracy of the model.

Datasets used:
1) WIKI/GOOGL dataset for predicting StockPrices. ( using LinearRegression )
2) breast-cancer-wisconsin.data (Original) dataset for predicting whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
( using K-nearest neighbors )
3) mnist dataset for predicting the handwritten digit recognition. ( using SVM )

Algortithms implemented from scratch:
1) K-nearest neighbors.
2) SVM
